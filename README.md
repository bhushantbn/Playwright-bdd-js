## 💻 About The Project

This project provides a comprehensive boilerplate for setting up end-to-end (E2E) tests using **Playwright** and **Cucumber.js**. It's designed to enable Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in a JavaScript environment, promoting collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.

The structure is built with scalability and maintainability in mind, incorporating best practices like the Page Object Model and Cucumber hooks for setup and teardown.

### ✨ Features

*   **🎭 Behavior-Driven Development:** Write tests in a human-readable Gherkin syntax.
*   **⚡ Modern Tooling:** Leverages the power and speed of Playwright for reliable browser automation.
*   **🏗️ Scalable Architecture:** Organized with the Page Object Model in mind for maintainable test code.
*   **🪝 Hooks:** Uses Cucumber's `Before` and `After` hooks for managing browser state (`features/helpers/hooks.js`).
*   **📊 Rich Reporting:** Generates a detailed Cucumber HTML report from a JSON feed.
*   **🌐 Cross-Browser:** Natively supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
*   **🔧 Extensible:** Easy to add custom steps, hooks, and configurations.

| :----------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Playwright**          | Browser automation library from Microsoft. |
| **Cucumber.js**          | BDD tool for writing tests in Gherkin.    |
| **`cucumber-html-reporter`** | Generates beautiful, standalone HTML reports. |
| **Node.js**               | JavaScript runtime environment.           |

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
*   Node.js (v16 or higher is recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### ⚙️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    *(Replace `<YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>` with the actual URL)*
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd Playwright-bdd-js
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install Playwright browsers:**
    This command downloads the browser binaries required by Playwright.
    ```sh
    npx playwright install
    ```

---

## 🏃‍➡️ Running Tests

The tests are executed using the `cucumber-js` CLI, which is wrapped in an `npm` script.

### Executing All Scenarios

To execute all BDD tests defined in the `.feature` files, run the following command:
```sh
npm test
```

This will trigger the Cucumber.js test runner, which will execute the scenarios defined in the `.feature` files.

## 📊 Viewing Reports

After a test run is complete, two types of reports are generated:

1.  **Playwright HTML Report:**
    This is the standard, feature-rich report generated by Playwright.
    -   **Location:** `playwright-report/index.html`
    -   **To view:** `npx playwright show-report`

2.  **Cucumber HTML Report:**
    This report provides a detailed view of the Gherkin features and scenarios and their execution status.
    -   **Location:** `reports/cucumber-report.html`
    -   **To view:** Open this file directly in your web browser.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project follows a standard BDD structure:

```
├── features/
│   ├── steps/          # Step definition files that map Gherkin steps to code
│   ├── login.feature   # Gherkin feature files describing test scenarios
├── playwright-report/    # Output directory for the Playwright HTML report
├── reports/              # Output directory for the Cucumber HTML report
└── ...                   # Other configuration files (package.json, etc.)
```

*   `features/`: This directory is the core of the BDD setup.
    *   `.feature` files contain the high-level test scenarios written in Gherkin.
    *   `steps/` sub-directory contains the JavaScript code that implements the steps defined in the feature files.
