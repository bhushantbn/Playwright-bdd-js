## ✨ Features

*   **Playwright:** For powerful and reliable end-to-end browser automation.
*   **Cucumber.js:** Enables BDD by allowing tests to be written in a human-readable Gherkin format (`.feature` files).
*   **Page Object Model:** A design pattern to create a reusable and maintainable test codebase (Assumed structure).
*   **Multiple Reporters:** Generates both the standard Playwright HTML report and a detailed Cucumber HTML report.
*   **Cross-browser:** Leverages Playwright's capability to run tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   Node.js (v16 or higher is recommended)
*   npm or yarn

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Playwright-bdd-js
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Playwright browsers:**
    This command downloads the browser binaries for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
    ```sh
    npx playwright install
    ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Tests in headed mode in local environment

To execute the BDD tests, run the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
npm run test
```

This will trigger the Cucumber.js test runner, which will execute the scenarios defined in the `.feature` files.

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Tests in headless mode

```sh

HEADLESS=true npm run test:contactus

```
---
## 📊 Viewing Reports

After a test run is complete, two types of reports are generated:

1.  **Playwright HTML Report:**
    This is the standard, feature-rich report generated by Playwright.
    -   **Location:** `playwright-report/index.html`
    -   **To view:** `npx playwright show-report`

2.  **Cucumber HTML Report:**
    This report provides a detailed view of the Gherkin features and scenarios and their execution status.
    -   **Location:** `reports/cucumber-report.html`
    -   **To view:** Open this file directly in your web browser.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project follows a standard BDD structure:

```
├── features/
│   ├── steps/          # Step definition files that map Gherkin steps to code
│   ├── login.feature   # Gherkin feature files describing test scenarios
├── playwright-report/    # Output directory for the Playwright HTML report
├── reports/              # Output directory for the Cucumber HTML report
└── ...                   # Other configuration files (package.json, etc.)
```

*   `features/`: This directory is the core of the BDD setup.
    *   `.feature` files contain the high-level test scenarios written in Gherkin.
    *   `steps/` sub-directory contains the JavaScript code that implements the steps defined in the feature files.
